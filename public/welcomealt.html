		You have officially been accepted in the Alcohol And Marijuana Study. Welcome to Project Sam. You have already taken a screening survey. In the future, you will be emailed a consent form and our official survey. If you pass both of these surveys, then you will enter our round of daily surveys. You will be paid for your daily surveys, but they will not be administered by this site. There will be an iPhone and Android Application to take you through your daily surveys. All data you submit in your surveys will be anonymous. We are very happy to have you involved with our study.
