        Project SAM is looking for volunteers like you to participate in a confidential study on the effects of Simultaneous Alcohol and Marijuana use. You can earn over $200 by completing the study, and you’ll be entered into a lottery to win one of 15 tablets by simply taking the screening survey.<br/><br/>

        	Alcohol and marijuana are the most commonly used substances (besides tobacco) on college campuses. Given that 19 states plus Washington D.C. have either decriminalized or legalized recreational marijuana use for individuals 18 or 21 and older, many college students will have greater access to marijuana, increasing the likelihood of simultaneous alcohol and marijuana (SAM) use. Therefore, it is imperative to understand more about the current epidemiology of this phenomenon and the unique motivational and contextual factors influencing SAM use.<br/><br/>
        The present study focuses on SAM use, which is defined as the use of alcohol and marijuana on the same occasion where the effects overlap. Currently, there are no data addressing individual and contextual factors that promote this high-risk behavior, and no detailed information regarding the nature and frequency of consequences arising from simultaneous use.<br/><br/>
        This study will examine present-day SAM use among 1,440 college students at three state universities, each with very different state laws regarding marijuana use, using a two-phase approach: a larger survey assessment coupled with a fine-grained daily survey design. The longer survey, administered prior to each 4-week daily assessment period to 480 students per campus, will allow us to determine how descriptive and injunctive norms and distal and proximal risk factors influence prevalence, patterns, consequences, and motivations of simultaneous and separate use of alcohol and marijuana. Daily web-based surveys will also be administered to a subsample of 120 students per campus for 4 weeks in the fall and again in the spring.<br/><br/>
        Our design allows us to examine both within- and between-individual predictors and consequences of SAM use and how SAM use is differentiated from either alcohol or marijuana use alone. This innovative, multi-site study will provide a theoretical and empirical basis for designing preventive interventions to reduce SAM use and related consequences by determining motivational and contextual targets for interventions as well as actual and perceived norms regarding SAM use. The results of the proposed research will provide critical and timely information to meet the needs of college administrators and counselors and also inform the marijuana legalization debate.<br/><br/>
